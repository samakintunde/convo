# Convo

### Notes

I've left this project fallow for too long and I can barely tell what's going on in this repo anymore. Also, it takes a long time for the client's dev server to reload as bulk of the time is spent typechecking typescript stuff. Styling was custom and poorly written. Managing dependencies for this monorepo is pretty hell too.
I'll be fixing these first before I proceed on this project.
